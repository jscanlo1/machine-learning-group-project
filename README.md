## Machine Learning Project
# Using Comment Sections to predict news reliablitiy

This project was done as part of a machine learning course I took in the final year of my MAI degree at Trinity College Dublin

This project uses several machine learning models, including deep learning, and compares them to a baseline.

Data was scraped using selenium.
